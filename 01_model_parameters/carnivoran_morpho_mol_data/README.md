# Prior on rates for the combined data set

The morphological partition accounts for population noise and within-lineage character correlation as it was the model supported by the BFs when 
using morphological data. The other two partitions are the 1st+2nd CPs and 3rd CPs, respectively.

The mean rate for this partitioned data set was calculated as the average of the mean rates of the morphological partition alone ($r_{morpho}=\alpha/\beta=2/5\sim 0.4$)
and the molecular partitions ($r_{mit12+3}=\alpha/\beta=2/100=0.02$), that is $r_{joint}=(0.4+0.02)/2=0.21$. 

Accordingly, $\mu_{\Gamma}=r_{joint}=\alpha/\beta$, hence $\beta=\alpha/r_{joint}=2/0.21=9.5\sim 10$. This means that the gamma prior on the rates used for this analysis was $\Gamma(2,10)$.
