# Description of tree file to be used by MCMCtree

The file `8s.tree` contains the tree topology of the phylogeny used for the simulations, which was the input tree used by `MCMCtree` during the Bayesian inference. It has the ages for the species already fixed as taxa names need 
to match with the names used in the alignment files.
